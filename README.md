# Webville

**Webville** is an open-source initiative to rethink how web systems are built — using language models as the core engine for content, interaction, and structure.

Rather than defining routes, writing forms, and setting up dashboards manually, developers in Webville describe what the system should *do* in natural language. From this, intelligent agents define the necessary data, operations, and user interactions.

Webville sites are not just websites. They're **living digital agents** — intelligent systems that understand their purpose, evolve with user input, and act on behalf of people and organizations.

## Why Webville?

Today's web apps are built with many layers — routes, APIs, admin panels, custom dashboards, database scaffolding, and more. These often grow stale, become inconsistent, or require high effort to maintain.

Webville introduces a new paradigm:

* **Conversational Admin Interfaces**: Manage your site by talking to it.
* **Dynamic Data Models**: Tables, schemas, and fields defined and adjusted through prompts.
* **Smart Caching & Routing**: Routes are generated on-the-fly and optimized through intelligent caching, not hardcoded endpoints.
* **LLM-Native Design**: Webville apps are designed from the ground up to work with language models, instead of simply embedding them.

## Use Cases

* Admins managing content-heavy platforms without rigid UIs
* Small teams launching advanced features without boilerplate
* Devs defining app structure and logic through high-level descriptions
* Anyone tired of rebuilding the same content management patterns

## Roadmap

* [ ] Define the Webville Specification
* [ ] Build initial prototype with SQLite + LLM core
* [ ] Develop adaptive prompt-to-action routing system
* [ ] Support modular plugins for payments, auth, integrations
* [ ] Form early working group to shape vision

## Get Involved

We’re currently looking for:

* **Developers** to shape early code and prototypes
* **Data Scientists** and **ML Engineers** to explore self-hosted LLM workflows
* **UX Thinkers** to help design fluid dialog-based interaction
* **Writers** and **Spec Authors** to refine the Webville Protocol
* **Backers and supporters** who believe in open innovation
